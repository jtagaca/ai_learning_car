## About

AI python self car learner demonstrates an AI car learner that can gradually learn to drive a race track.

## Context

This AI self-learning car allows it to learn by recording if it could produce an offspring that was able to pass the race track. It knows that this generation of cars succeeded by checking if any number greater than 0 has been able to cycle the entire track. The cars also learn from their mistakes while moving on the race track using their sensors. The new generation then creates a new type of car that can learn from the previous generation's mistakes. For the cars to display the UI pygame was used,Â neural networks are then utilized for the cars to learn to drive.
